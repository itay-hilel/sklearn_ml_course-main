# Module 7 -- Evaluating model performance

## Wrap-up
In this module, we presented the framework used in machine-learning to evaluate a predictive modelâ€™s performance: the cross-validation.

Besides, we presented several splitting strategies that can be used in the general cross-validation framework. These strategies should be used wisely when encountering some specific patterns or types of data.

Finally, we show how to perform nested cross-validation to select an optimal model and evaluate its generalization performance.
